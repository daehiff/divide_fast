# A Recursively Partitioned Approach to Architecture-Aware ZX Polynomial Synthesis and Optimization
This repository contains the source code to replicate the work presented in our paper titled "A Recursively Partitioned Approach to Architecture-Aware ZX Polynomial Synthesis and Optimization", which can be found in this [Arxiv preprint](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.17366.pdf).

## Setup using Conda
To install the required dependencies, simply run the following command:
```bash
conda env create --file architecture_aware_synth.yaml
```

## Evaluations
The code for our experiments can be found in `evaluations.py`. The resulting data, plots, and circuits can be found in the `evaluations/` directory.

## Tests
We have included some unit tests for this project, which can be found in the `tests/` directory.
