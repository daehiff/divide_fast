# A recursively partitioned approach to architecture-aware ZX Polynomial synthesis and optimization

The repository contains the source code to replicate the work from our Paper: "A recursively partitioned approach to architecture-aware ZX Polynomial synthesis and optimization" (Arxiv - preprint: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.17366.pdf)


## Setup (Conda)

To install the required dependencies, run:

```bash
conda env create --file architecture_aware_synth.yaml
```

## Evaluations

The code for our experiments can be found in `evaluations.py`. The resulting data, plots and circuits in `evaluations/`. 

## Tests

We added some unit tests to this project, see the `tests`.
